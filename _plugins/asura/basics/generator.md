A longer set of characters will produce a higher chance of creating a unique key, and a number of the license key can be generated.

7. (Optional) Fill the “Prefix”, “Suffix”, and “Separator” field with character or string. The value will be inserted into license key.
8. (Optional) Fill the “Max Activation”, and “Expire in” field with number. The license will expire after several day(s) and have limited activation.
