If you bought or given access to a design set from the *Provider*, you’ll be given a `connector string` and `license`.

**connector string:** contains a configuration allowing your site to communicate to the *Provider*’s site securely.

**license:** is needed to authenticate you on the *Provider*’s site. Your license is your identity and used to manage the access to design sets and the expiration of access (if subscription-based).

6. **(Optional)** If you just start a new website, you may want to install a complete website (demo website) from the design set. Adjust the options and click the “Install” link on the design set you are want to install. The action will import the configuration from the *Provider*’s site.
